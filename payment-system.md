# Payment System (ex Stripe, paypal, square etc)

<img width="820" height="463" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e3338bb-78d4-4405-aff0-0fd6d1234737" />

Here's how the payment process works step by step:

**1. Customer Initiates Payment**
- Customer enters payment details (card number, CVV, etc.) on the merchant's website
- This happens through a secure form, often embedded via the payment gateway's SDK

**2. Merchant Website to Payment Gateway**
- Merchant's website securely sends payment data to the Payment Gateway API
- The gateway tokenizes sensitive card data for security
- Initial validation happens (format checks, basic fraud screening)

**3. Payment Processing**
- Payment Gateway forwards the transaction to a Payment Processor
- Processor formats the request according to card network standards (Visa, Mastercard, etc.)

**4. Bank Network Authorization**
- Request goes through the card network (Visa/Mastercard) to the customer's bank
- Customer's bank checks account balance, fraud patterns, and approves/declines
- Response travels back through the network

**5. Response Handling**
- Payment Gateway receives the authorization response
- Updates transaction status in database
- Fraud detection systems may flag suspicious transactions
- Notifications are sent to both merchant and customer

**6. Settlement (Later)**
- Approved funds are transferred from customer's bank to merchant's bank
- This typically happens in batches, 1-3 business days later
- Payment gateway handles the settlement process

**Key Components:**
- **Payment Gateway**: Secure interface that handles the entire flow
- **Database**: Stores transaction records and merchant data
- **Fraud Detection**: AI/ML systems that analyze patterns
- **Notifications**: Email/SMS confirmations and webhooks to merchants

This simplified architecture handles billions of transactions by being stateless, highly available, and processing payments asynchronously where possible.

# Payment Gateway vs Payment Processor vs Stripe
Great question! Let me break down the differences between these three concepts:

## Payment Gateway
**What it is:** A service that securely captures and transmits payment data
- **Function:** Acts as the "front door" - handles the initial payment request, tokenization, and basic validation
- **Examples:** Authorize.Net, Square Gateway, PayPal Payments Pro
- **Analogy:** Like a cashier at a store who takes your card and processes it

## Payment Processor  
**What it is:** The backend system that actually moves money between banks
- **Function:** Handles the complex bank-to-bank communication, authorization, and settlement
- **Examples:** First Data, Chase Paymentech, Worldpay
- **Analogy:** Like the bank's computer system that checks your account and moves the money

## Stripe
**What it is:** A **full-stack payment platform** that combines both gateway AND processor
- **Function:** Handles everything from payment capture to bank settlement, plus developer tools
- **Unique value:** Complete solution with APIs, dashboard, fraud protection, and global reach
- **Analogy:** Like having both the cashier AND the bank system in one integrated service

## Key Differences:

**Traditional Setup:**
```
Merchant â†’ Payment Gateway â†’ Payment Processor â†’ Banks
```

**Stripe Setup:**
```
Merchant â†’ Stripe (Gateway + Processor + More) â†’ Banks
```

**Why Stripe is Different:**
- **All-in-one:** You don't need separate gateway and processor contracts
- **Developer-first:** Clean APIs and extensive documentation
- **Global:** Built-in support for international payments and currencies
- **Additional services:** Subscription billing, marketplace payments, financial reporting

**When to use what:**
- **Traditional Gateway + Processor:** When you need maximum control or have specific enterprise requirements
- **Stripe:** When you want simplicity, fast integration, and modern tooling
- **Other full-stack solutions:** PayPal, Square, Adyen (Stripe competitors)

Think of it this way: Payment gateways and processors are like buying separate components, while Stripe is like buying a complete, integrated system.

# ðŸ’³ Payment System Design: Auth, Capture, Refund, Chargeback

---

## 1. Core Concepts

### Entities

#### 1. Merchant
- The business selling goods/services (e.g., online store).
- Initiates payment requests via a payment gateway.

#### 2. Payment Gateway
- Interface between merchant and financial network.
- Collects card details, sends **authorization/capture** requests, returns responses.
- Examples: Stripe, Razorpay, PayPal.

#### 3. Payment Processor
- Moves actual money between banks.
- Executes card network communications.
- Usually hidden behind the gateway.

#### 4. Customer
- Provides card/payment details to complete purchase.

---

## 2. Key Payment Operations

### Authorization (Auth)
- Reserve funds on the customerâ€™s card.
- Money is not moved yet.
- Status: `authorized`

### Capture
- Finalize and move the reserved funds to merchant.
- Can be **full or partial**.
- Status: `captured`

### Refund
- Return money to customer after capture.
- Status: `refunded`

### Chargeback
- Customer disputes transaction via their bank.
- Funds withdrawn from merchant and put on hold.
- Status: `chargeback`

---

## 3. Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE payments (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    order_id INT,
    amount DECIMAL(10,2),
    currency VARCHAR(3),
    status VARCHAR(20),       -- pending, authorized, captured, refunded, chargeback
    auth_id VARCHAR(50),
    capture_id VARCHAR(50),
    refund_id VARCHAR(50),
    chargeback_id VARCHAR(50),
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Sample Data
INSERT INTO payments (user_id, order_id, amount, currency, status, auth_id, capture_id, refund_id, chargeback_id, created_at, updated_at)
VALUES
(1, 101, 100.00, 'USD', 'authorized', 'auth_001', NULL, NULL, NULL, NOW(), NOW()),
(2, 102, 50.00, 'USD', 'captured', 'auth_002', 'cap_002', NULL, NULL, NOW(), NOW()),
(3, 103, 200.00, 'USD', 'chargeback', 'auth_003', 'cap_003', NULL, 'cb_003', NOW(), NOW());
````

## 5. Payment Status Flow (State Machine)

```text
pending -> authorized -> captured -> refunded
                             -> chargeback
```

### Sample Table

| payment\_id | user\_id | order\_id | status     | auth\_id  | capture\_id | refund\_id | chargeback\_id |
| ----------- | -------- | --------- | ---------- | --------- | ----------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| 1           | 1        | 101       | authorized | auth\_001 | NULL        | NULL       | NULL           |
| 2           | 2        | 102       | captured   | auth\_002 | cap\_002    | NULL       | NULL           |
| 3           | 3        | 103       | chargeback | auth\_003 | cap\_003    | NULL       | cb\_003        |

---

## 6. System Design Considerations

* **Idempotency**: All API endpoints should handle retries gracefully.
* **Webhooks**: Used for asynchronous events like chargebacks and refunds.
* **Event-Driven Architecture**: Event queue (Kafka/RabbitMQ) can log payment events.
* **Auditing & Compliance**: Store immutable logs for PCI DSS compliance.
* **Fraud Detection**: Monitor unusual patterns (e.g., many chargebacks).
* **Timeouts & Retries**: Handle bank/gateway errors gracefully.

```
### âœ… Role Summary:

* **Customer (User)**: Makes the purchase with card.
* **Merchant (Store)**: Sells product/service and requests payment.
* **Stripe (Gateway + Processor)**:

  * **Gateway**: Accepts and routes card details.
  * **Processor**: Talks to the customerâ€™s and merchantâ€™s bank to move funds.
* **Bank**:

  * **Issuer**: Customerâ€™s bank (auths/declines transactions).
  * **Acquirer**: Merchantâ€™s bank (receives captured funds).
