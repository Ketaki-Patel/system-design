Here's how the payment process works step by step:

**1. Customer Initiates Payment**
- Customer enters payment details (card number, CVV, etc.) on the merchant's website
- This happens through a secure form, often embedded via the payment gateway's SDK

**2. Merchant Website to Payment Gateway**
- Merchant's website securely sends payment data to the Payment Gateway API
- The gateway tokenizes sensitive card data for security
- Initial validation happens (format checks, basic fraud screening)

**3. Payment Processing**
- Payment Gateway forwards the transaction to a Payment Processor
- Processor formats the request according to card network standards (Visa, Mastercard, etc.)

**4. Bank Network Authorization**
- Request goes through the card network (Visa/Mastercard) to the customer's bank
- Customer's bank checks account balance, fraud patterns, and approves/declines
- Response travels back through the network

**5. Response Handling**
- Payment Gateway receives the authorization response
- Updates transaction status in database
- Fraud detection systems may flag suspicious transactions
- Notifications are sent to both merchant and customer

**6. Settlement (Later)**
- Approved funds are transferred from customer's bank to merchant's bank
- This typically happens in batches, 1-3 business days later
- Payment gateway handles the settlement process

**Key Components:**
- **Payment Gateway**: Secure interface that handles the entire flow
- **Database**: Stores transaction records and merchant data
- **Fraud Detection**: AI/ML systems that analyze patterns
- **Notifications**: Email/SMS confirmations and webhooks to merchants

This simplified architecture handles billions of transactions by being stateless, highly available, and processing payments asynchronously where possible.

# Payment Gateway vs Payment Processor vs Stripe
Great question! Let me break down the differences between these three concepts:

## Payment Gateway
**What it is:** A service that securely captures and transmits payment data
- **Function:** Acts as the "front door" - handles the initial payment request, tokenization, and basic validation
- **Examples:** Authorize.Net, Square Gateway, PayPal Payments Pro
- **Analogy:** Like a cashier at a store who takes your card and processes it

## Payment Processor  
**What it is:** The backend system that actually moves money between banks
- **Function:** Handles the complex bank-to-bank communication, authorization, and settlement
- **Examples:** First Data, Chase Paymentech, Worldpay
- **Analogy:** Like the bank's computer system that checks your account and moves the money

## Stripe
**What it is:** A **full-stack payment platform** that combines both gateway AND processor
- **Function:** Handles everything from payment capture to bank settlement, plus developer tools
- **Unique value:** Complete solution with APIs, dashboard, fraud protection, and global reach
- **Analogy:** Like having both the cashier AND the bank system in one integrated service

## Key Differences:

**Traditional Setup:**
```
Merchant → Payment Gateway → Payment Processor → Banks
```

**Stripe Setup:**
```
Merchant → Stripe (Gateway + Processor + More) → Banks
```

**Why Stripe is Different:**
- **All-in-one:** You don't need separate gateway and processor contracts
- **Developer-first:** Clean APIs and extensive documentation
- **Global:** Built-in support for international payments and currencies
- **Additional services:** Subscription billing, marketplace payments, financial reporting

**When to use what:**
- **Traditional Gateway + Processor:** When you need maximum control or have specific enterprise requirements
- **Stripe:** When you want simplicity, fast integration, and modern tooling
- **Other full-stack solutions:** PayPal, Square, Adyen (Stripe competitors)

Think of it this way: Payment gateways and processors are like buying separate components, while Stripe is like buying a complete, integrated system.
