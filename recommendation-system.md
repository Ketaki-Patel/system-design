# üìò RecoMind: YouTube-Style Short Video Recommendation System

---

## üéØ 1. Purpose of the System

We are building a **recommendation system** for a **short video platform**, similar to YouTube Shorts or TikTok.

RecoMind will:

- Recommend short videos to users based on their activity
- Track user behavior (views, likes, skips)
- Show personalized recommendations
- Show trending videos to new or logged-out users

---

## ‚úÖ 2. Functional Requirements

### üé• Core User Features:

- Watch short videos
- Like or skip a video
- View personalized video recommendations
- View trending videos when not logged in

### üß† System Behavior:

- Collect user interaction data (likes, views, skips)
- Build user profiles based on behavior
- Recommend Top N short videos per user

---

## üí° 3. How the Recommendation Engine Works

### üß± Strategies Used

| Strategy              | Description                                                                 | Used in RecoMind |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| Content-based        | Recommends videos similar to what the user already liked                    | ‚úÖ Yes           |
| Collaborative        | Recommends videos liked by users with similar tastes                        | ‚úÖ Yes           |
| Hybrid               | Combines both content-based and collaborative approaches                   | ‚úÖ Core approach |
| Popularity-based     | Recommends trending content for new users                                   | ‚úÖ Yes           |

### üë• Example

- User A liked videos tagged with `#funny`, `#meme`.
- Content-based: suggests other `#funny`, `#meme` videos.
- Collaborative: finds that other users who liked the same also liked `#dance` videos.
- Final recommendation is a mix of all.

## üóÉÔ∏è 4. Database Design

We will use **PostgreSQL** for core storage and **Redis** for caching.

### üìÑ Tables

---

#### 1. `users`

| Column        | Type     |
|---------------|----------|
| `user_id`     | UUID     |
| `name`        | TEXT     |
| `created_at`  | TIMESTAMP |

---

#### 2. `videos`

| Column        | Type     |
|---------------|----------|
| `video_id`    | UUID     |
| `title`       | TEXT     |
| `url`         | TEXT     |
| `tags`        | TEXT[]   |
| `creator_id`  | UUID     |
| `created_at`  | TIMESTAMP |

---

#### 3. `video_actions`

| Column        | Type                         |
|---------------|------------------------------|
| `id`          | UUID                         |
| `user_id`     | UUID                         |
| `video_id`    | UUID                         |
| `action_type` | TEXT (`view`, `like`, `skip`)|
| `timestamp`   | TIMESTAMP                    |

---

#### 4. `user_profiles`

| Column        | Type     |
|---------------|----------|
| `user_id`     | UUID     |
| `top_tags`    | TEXT[]   |
| `updated_at`  | TIMESTAMP |

---

#### 5. `video_popularity`

| Column         | Type     |
|----------------|----------|
| `video_id`     | UUID     |
| `score`        | FLOAT    |
| `last_updated` | TIMESTAMP |

---

## üåê 5. API Design

---

### üîπ GET `/recommendations/{user_id}`

Returns top N personalized videos.

**Sample Response**
```json
[
  {
    "video_id": "v1",
    "title": "Epic Funny Fail",
    "url": "https://...",
    "tags": ["funny", "meme"]
  },
  ...
]
````

Uses **Redis cache**. Fallback to DB if cache is cold.

---

### üîπ POST `/video_action`

Tracks feedback on videos.

**Sample Request**

```json
{
  "user_id": "u1",
  "video_id": "v1",
  "action_type": "like"
}
```

Event is sent to **Kafka** for processing.

---

### üîπ GET `/trending`

Returns globally popular videos.

---

## ‚ö° 6. Caching Strategy

Using **Redis** for fast access.

| Cache Key                   | Description             | TTL     |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------- |
| `recommendations:{user_id}` | Top videos for the user | 10 mins |
| `popular_videos`            | Top trending videos     | 15 mins |
| `user_profile:{user_id}`    | Precomputed top tags    | 30 mins |

---

## üîÑ 7. Streaming with Kafka

All user interactions (view, like, skip) are published to a Kafka topic.

### Kafka Topic: `video_actions_stream`

**Sample Kafka Message**

```json
{
  "user_id": "u1",
  "video_id": "v1",
  "action_type": "view",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-23T12:00:00Z"
}
```

**Kafka Consumers:**

* Insert into `video_actions`
* Update `video_popularity`
* Update `user_profiles`
* Trigger offline model retraining

---

## üîü 8. Top-N Recommendation Generation

### Step-by-Step Flow:

1. User watches or likes a video ‚Üí tracked via API
2. Action is sent to Kafka ‚Üí stored in DB
3. Batch job (hourly):

   * Updates popularity score
   * Updates user‚Äôs top tags
4. Match user tags with video tags (content-based)
5. Find similar users (collaborative)
6. Blend recommendations
7. Store top results in `recommendations:{user_id}` Redis key

---

## üìä 9. Sample Data

### User

```json
{
  "user_id": "u1",
  "name": "Alice"
}
```

### Video

```json
{
  "video_id": "v1",
  "title": "Epic Dog Fails",
  "tags": ["funny", "animals"],
  "url": "https://..."
}
```

### Video Action

```json
{
  "user_id": "u1",
  "video_id": "v1",
  "action_type": "like"
}
```

---

## üß† 10. How It All Works (Human-Friendly Summary)

1. User watches or likes a video ‚Üí system stores it
2. It tracks what kind of videos (tags) the user likes
3. Every hour, it matches new videos with those tags
4. Also checks what similar users liked
5. Combines the results and stores them in Redis
6. When the user opens the app, recommendations load instantly

## ‚úÖ Recap

| Area                    | Summary                                          |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Functional Requirements | Watch, like, recommend videos                    |
| Recommendation Types    | Content-based + collaborative + hybrid           |
| DB Tables               | Users, Videos, Video Actions, Profiles           |
| APIs                    | `/recommendations`, `/video_action`, `/trending` |
| Caching                 | Redis for fast lookup                            |
| Streaming               | Kafka for real-time ingestion                    |
| Top-N Logic             | Hourly batch job + Redis + API serving           |

## üîß Future Improvements

* Add Machine Learning model for smarter predictions
* Personalize feed by time of day, location
* Add A/B testing for ranking models
* Real-time updates (event-driven scores)
